# ARF Research

Shapiro Lab, Caltech

On going project to validate numerical framework to:
1. Generate and analyze arbitrary acoustic fields
2. Compute acoustic forces based on a precomputed arbitrary acoustic field
3. Train machine learning model for maximizing one or more of the acoustic forces

Using Matlabs propagation toolbox k-Wave as basis for framework. Extracting various acoustic forces of interest based on k-Wave simulations of acoustic field, including ARF in x, z dimensions, ARF in the nucleus and in the cell.
